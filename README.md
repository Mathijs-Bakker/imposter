## GodotVersion
From `git log` to `SemVer` to `Godot` in no time. An automation plugin working with `GitVersion`

The GodotVersion plugin makes it easier to manage version updates for your Godot projects. It works with GitVersion and a git pre-commit hook to update the project version automatically when a build is started - both for debug and exports.

This plugin can be used for both game and non-game projects.
